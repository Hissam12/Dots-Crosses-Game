# Dots-Crosses-Game
Project Summary
The general Dots and Crosses Game with an applied Minimax Algorithm
This project is a Python-based implementation of the Dots and Crosses game (also known as Dots and Boxes), featuring a computer opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The game, built using the Pygame library, offers a single-player mode where the computer uses Minimax to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging experience. The project demonstrates the application of game theory and artificial intelligence in a classic game.
